Hello!
My name is Artem Dubovetskyi and I did my M.Sc. here at Weizmann in the lab of Prof. Dan Tawfik. There I worked with enzymes and tried to use them as part of a [labelling system inside the cell](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cbic.202000611). Now I am a Ph.D. student in Dr. Hagen Hofmann's lab, working with inrinsically disordered proteins, trying to establish the connection between their structural changes and their role in the living cell. 
I like to work with proteins of all types (except membrane proteins).
  
Some chihuahua for fun:
